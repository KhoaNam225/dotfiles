# Dotfiles config for local development

In this repo, I'm configuring all my dotfiles for most of the utilities that I'm using for my development workflow.
The utilities include:

* Zsh: My main shell
* Neovim: My text editor
* Starship: Decorating terminal prompts
* Atuin: Commands history mananger
* Eza: Better "ls"
